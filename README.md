### DAO

### In this project we create a DAO that allows members to join and propose different investment ideas to the group. Members can either vote to accept or reject the proposals which are then tallied. If the majority of members vote "Yes" then the group will move forward with the proposal. Note a voting "deadline" is set to ensure members can only vote within the voting period. Other safeguards are put in place to ensure only members that hold valid tokens (NFT) can vote or propose ideas as well as ensuring members can not vote more than once on a proposal.


### This project was compiled and deployed successfully to the Rinkeby network. As seen from the photos below, the members of this DAO can be seen on OpenSea. Only the users that hold the NFT are members of this DAO and therefore are the only ones that can create proposals and/or vote on them.
